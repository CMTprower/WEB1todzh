Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]<br></p>
<p><strong>CSS</strong> is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]<br> This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.<br>
Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
and on Braille-based tactile devices.<br> CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]<br>
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element<br>
This cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br></p>
<p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C).<br>
Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).<br>
The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]<br>
In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS, including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>
